# Selenium Testing Automation
This is a small project using selenium webDriver basically using Chrome.

This project is testing a countdown timer application. 

Initially, it verifies that the application loading is complete.

Then the counter functionality is verified if it is counting down every second.

It is also tested and verified that the application ended the timer successfully.


## Further enhancement

Using other browsers to test the common functionality.

Add more tests on the main functions available.

Optimize code.
